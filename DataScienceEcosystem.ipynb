    "## Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:\n",
    "1. **Pyhton** - Python has a vast standard library and a vibrant ecosystem of third-party packages, making it suitable for a wide range of applications such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more. Its versatility and ease of use have contributed to its popularity among developers worldwide.\n",
    "2. **R** - R is especially popular among statisticians, data analysts, and researchers for its extensive collection of packages designed for various statistical tasks. It offers a rich set of built-in functions and libraries for data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, regression, machine learning, and more.\n",
    "3. **SQL** - SQL is widely used in database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and many others. It is an essential skill for anyone working with data, as virtually all modern applications and systems rely on databases to store and retrieve information."
